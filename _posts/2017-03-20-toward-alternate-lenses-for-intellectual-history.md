No one working in academia, even at its peripheries, can avoid being aware of citations as an important metric of intellectual influence. Nor will they have escaped a discussion of the illustrious-in-the-extreme lineage of this or that professor. These two characterizations of intellectual history lie at alternate poles: one a catchall, the other failing to capture a polyphony of influences. 

The other day as I downloaded syllabi for courses that interest me but that I didn’t have the opportunity to take during my now dusking undergraduate career, it struck me that I was engaging with an alternate narrative of intellectual history. One that has not as yet (as far as I know) been analyzed in a systematic manner: the syllabus. 

As I downloaded the various syllabi from a wide range of departments I wondered: which of these articles are the most important for me to read? Which occur in multiple of these classes. Then I realized many other questions could be asked: how does the syllabus of a single course, or of the mass of courses offered by the University each year shift over time? Which scholars are relevant across the most number of disciplines? 

I realized that this is exactly the type of question that can be approached with some basic text processing. Here are my results comparing multiple years of the first-term proseminar in anthropology and history and seeing which scholars appeared in at least one year for both subjects:

In this instance, I manually downloaded the syllabi, but it would be possible to crawl for them, and indeed crawl for every syllabus on Princeton’s blackboard. As you can see, some names, such as Knopf, slipped through my naïve filtering and are not authors assigned in the class but the publisher. 

Still this already gives us some insight on this specific topic. Because these are scholars that every first-year history and anthropology grad student must read, we are already getting some idea of what the next generation of workers in these fields will be aware of as a baseline.
