Though access to and use of the internet has grown wildly over the past 8 or so years that I and most in my cohort have been heavy users, the number of platforms through that allow young people to express themselves online in a fully configurable way has shrunk. I have written on this blog about the dangers of centralization in terms of data storage. There are problems that come with centralization beyond this. 

My own experience is that most of the most widely used social networks require me to shoehorn my ideas and self-presentation into limiting forms. Photo-first posts or 140 character bites. I have been thinking more about ways to push back on this, satirizing those platforms on the same. But this still leads me to some of the same problems. And certainly still allows facebook to profit from me and continue to use their profits to destroy the Newark public school system. 

Through my frustration in this experimentation, I decided to create a [neocities site][neocities]. Neocities is a replica of geocities, a fully configurable and user-friendly hosting system that was shut down 8 years ago. This demonstrates another issue with centralized storage-based services: shutdown by the operator. I heard of neocities through its IPFS integration, which makes the platform robust against shutdown. Creating a platform of this sort without a single centralized database provider (as an option) and without direction toward a certain format for the sites is really exciting. I’ve had a great time lurking around the sites people are creating.

My ideas of what form a website should take have been influenced by the platforms I interact with most online. My neocities profile plays with tropes from other platforms. It’s silly. It’s brutalist. I won’t fight this, but I will continue to use it as a scratchpad for things that don’t really fit elsewhere (and probably shouldn’t be online).
