This site is intended as a record of my thoughts as I complete my senior thesis in Computer Science at Princeton. It will also record my thoughts on other projects that I am thinking about or working on, because in my view these are all ultimately connected.

My work to date has been mostly in natural language processing, most recently of the applied variety. This area is near and dear to my heart but I have recently become interested in blockchain and decentralization. 

These are hints to what might appear here, but it is possible that I will diverge from these themes.

I do not expect a readership but if you do end up here and find something interesting in what I have to say, I would love to hear from you!
